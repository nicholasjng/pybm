# The `init` command

```shell
âžœ pybm init -h
usage: pybm init <config-dir> [<options>]

    Initialize pybm in a git repository by adding a configuration file
    and an environment list into a directory.
    

positional arguments:
  <config-dir>          Directory in which to store the pybm configuration data.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this message and exit.
  -v                    Enable verbose mode. Makes pybm log information that might be useful for debugging.
  --rm                  Overwrite existing configuration.
  -o OVERRIDES, --override OVERRIDES
                        Override a value by hand for the newly created pybm configuration file.
```

The `pybm init` command creates a configuration file and a state file that tracks the currently available benchmark
environments. It is normally the first command you run in your `pybm` benchmarking workflow.

By passing the `--rm` option, you can reset an already existing configuration file to a default state.

The `-o/--override` switch can be used to override default values. If you are not satisfied with the default options, or
need to tweak a specific setting to suit your needs, supply your value of choice with the `key=value` syntax:

```shell
# this sets runner and builder to custom classes
pybm init -o runner.name=MyRunner -o builder.name=MyPythonBuilder
```

(If you are wondering about the default values or the names of certain config options, run the
command `pybm config list`.)

The `-o` switch can be used multiple times to set multiple different values at the same time. If you have a lot of
default values that you want to set, and do not want to type out long commands each time, consider writing a global pybm
config - this feature will be added in an upcoming release.
